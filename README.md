- `PLAYER_DETECTION` - Detects players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball in the 
video. Essential for identifying and tracking the presence of players and other 
entities on the field.

```bash
  uv run main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-player-detection.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode PLAYER_DETECTION
```

## ðŸš€ Web Interface

A React web application is provided to upload a video and view the processed
result. The frontend lives in the `frontend/` folder and uses Vite for
development.

### Start the backend

Run the FastAPI server from the repository root:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### Start the frontend

Install the Node dependencies once and then launch the Vite development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Use the form on the
"Solution" page to upload a video and choose one or more analysis modes. Each
mode will produce a separate processed video when the backend finishes
processing.
